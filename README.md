ZOOlanders UX framework

## Developers

First of all, install [Node](http://nodejs.org/). We use [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) to build zlux. If you haven't used Gulp before, you need to install the `gulp` package as a global install.

```
npm install --global gulp
```

Run gulp to build and minify the release.

```
gulp
```
